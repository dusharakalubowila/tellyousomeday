## 💭 **The Story Behind TellYouSomeday**

Sometimes the most important words are the hardest to say. Whether it's because of fear, distance, timing, or even death, there are messages that deserve to be heard, even when we can't deliver them ourselves.

TellYouSomeday gives voice to the unspoken - the love letters never sent, the gratitude never expressed, the final words that deserve to be heard, and the wisdom that should be passed down through generations.
