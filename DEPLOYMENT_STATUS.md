# Deployment Status Check - Latest Update

**Date:** 2025-06-19
**Status:** Checking deployment status after suspected URL change

## Issue
- The previously working URL `oyster-app-wqf7o.ondigitalocean.app` is no longer resolving
- Need to redeploy or check DigitalOcean dashboard for current status

## Actions Taken
1. Verified local fullstack setup is working perfectly
2. Created deployment checker script
3. Confirmed all code is ready for deployment

## Next Steps
1. Push this change to trigger new deployment
2. Check DigitalOcean dashboard
3. Update deployment URLs once new deployment is live

## Local Test Results âœ…
- Frontend builds successfully
- Backend server starts and serves both API and static files
- Health endpoint responds correctly
- All endpoints are configured properly

The code is ready - just need the deployment to complete.
