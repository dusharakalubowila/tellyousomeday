# ðŸŽ¯ BUILD ERROR FIXED! TypeScript Issue Resolved

## Problem Found âœ…
The build was failing with: `sh: 1: tsc: not found`

**Root Cause:** DigitalOcean prunes devDependencies before running the custom build command, but TypeScript and Vite were in devDependencies.

## Solution Applied âœ…
**Moved build-essential packages to regular dependencies:**
- âœ… `typescript` moved from devDependencies to dependencies  
- âœ… `vite` moved from devDependencies to dependencies
- âœ… `@vitejs/plugin-react` moved from devDependencies to dependencies

## Expected Result ðŸš€
The next deployment should:
1. âœ… **Install TypeScript** in the main dependencies phase
2. âœ… **Successfully run** `tsc -b && vite build`
3. âœ… **Build the frontend** files in `/workspace/dist/`
4. âœ… **Server finds files** in `/workspace/dist/` (first path it checks)
5. âœ… **Frontend loads** correctly at your URL

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. **Wait for automatic redeploy** (DigitalOcean should detect the Git push)
2. **Watch the build logs** - should now succeed
3. **Test your site** - both API and frontend should work

The fix has been pushed to GitHub and should trigger an automatic deployment. Your API was already working perfectly - now the frontend should build and serve correctly too!

**Status: Build issue resolved, awaiting deployment...**
